# Subliminal View

> An open source alternative to Sublime Text based on vim and urxvt

Current version: 0.1a1

**Attention: this in an alpha release. Don't use it on production environments as
you will probably experience bugs.**

*Subliminal View* is a group of Vim plugins and configurations designed to resemble
the appeareance and functionality of Sublime Text. Its main purpose is to make
users from Sublime to be more comfortable using Vim and perhaps encourage them
to switch IDE environments in the future.

*Subliminal View* needs a graphical interface to work because we need urxvt for
proper key shorcuts, but in the future this might change. This means it won't
work on server environments, sorry. *Subliminal View* ships as a separate binary
and does not integrate with Vim (yet). See [Usage](#usage) for details.

Also, for now we are only supporting Debian-based systems on the installation
script, but you might want to try installing on a different OS and tell us how
you you did it, or submit a
[greatly appreciated PR](https://github.com/LuisAlejandro/subliminal-view/pulls).

## Installation

First make sure that you have `sudo` and `curl` installed. If not, you can install it by opening
a root terminal and typing the following command:

```bash
apt-get install sudo curl
```

Then, open a user terminal and start the installation process with the following command.
This will take a few minutes to complete depending on your internet connection speed.

```bash
bash <(curl -fLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuisAlejandro/subliminal-view/development/install.sh)
```

## Usage

You can click on Subliminal Vim's icon on the menu or execute it on console by
typing `subliminal-view`.

You can use the mouse to select documents on the panel, single click opens them.
You cannot select tabs by clicking on them (yet), you'll have to use key shorcuts
for that (Alt+1, Alt+2, ...).

### Common key shortcuts

| `Ctrl-o` | Open document |
| `Ctrl-s` | Save document |
| `Ctrl-c` | Copy a block or single line of code |
| `Ctrl-x` | Cut a block or single line of code |
| `Ctrl-v` | Paste a block or single line of code |
| `Ctrl-z` | Undo last action |
| `Ctrl-y` | Redo last action |
